# Design patterns

This project is a personal initiative in which the main goal is to practice and learn about design patterns.
 Most of the design patterns are unknown for the majority because in some occasions they are  not applicable in 
 specific contexts. with this initiative we can give them a look and understand what is its main purpose even if we 
 are not going to use them in the near future.

## Factory method

The factory method is a creational pattern, which in my case is the pattern that I remember the most, that provides a
way to create objects.
